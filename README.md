# SOLID
**The SOLID Principles are five principles of Object-Oriented class design. They are a set of rules and best practices to follow while designing a class structure.**
1- **The Single Responsibility Principle**
2- **The Open-Closed Principle**
3- **The Liskov Substitution Principle**
4- **The Interface Segregation Principle**
5- **The Dependency Inversion Principle**

# SRP ->> Single Responsibility Principle :
### a class should do one thing and therefore it should have only a single reason to change.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# OCP ->> Open-Closed Principle :
### classes should be open for extension and closed to modification.
*Modification means changing the code of an existing class, and extension means adding new functionality.*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# LSP ->> Liskov Substitution Principle :
###  subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.
*This means that, given that class B is a subclass of class A, we should be able to pass an object of class B to any method that expects an object of class A and the method should not give any weird output in that case.*
